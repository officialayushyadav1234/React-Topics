//--------------- State ---------------

1. State is used to store data at component level.

2. In class based component there is a property called as state so class 
   based component is called as Statefull component.

3. In function based component there is no built in property called as 
   state so it is called as StateLess Component.

4. We can make Function based component as statefull by using a 
   hook called as useState().
